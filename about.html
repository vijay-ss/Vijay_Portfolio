								My name is Vijay Saddi and I am currently a Senior Data Analyst in the Telecommunications
								industry. I have a BSc in Psychology from York University and a Post-Graduate Certificate in Business Analytics.
								<br>
								<br>
								I first became interested in data after my internship at Reliance Foundation in Bombay, India. I
								worked in the Health Information Team, where I was involved in many projects involving heavy use
								of customer data. At this point I didn't have a background on performing basic analyses, but found
								it extremely interesting to manipulate. At this moment I knew I wanted to build a career in Data.
								<br>
								<br>
								With the wealth of resources online, I gradually started learning the field, starting with some basic
								Python code and building from there on. Since then, I have completed several certificates including: IBM's Data Science
								Specialization and Python for Data Science and Machine Learning. Since then, I have applied my knowledge by
								completing some relevant projects such as a Covid-19 Outbreak Tracker dashboard, and market research for a business proposal.
								<br>
								<br>
								This is my jorney to date, with the main goal of helping to drive the industry forward by changing lives.
